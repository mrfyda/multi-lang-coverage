##Installation:
Add the latest version of `codacy-coverage` to your package.json:
```
npm install codacy-coverage --save
```

If you're using mocha, add `mocha-lcov-reporter` to your package.json:
```
npm install mocha-lcov-reporter --save
```

##Usage:

This script ( `bin/codacy-coverage.js` ) can take standard input from any tool that emits the lcov data format (including [mocha](http://mochajs.org)'s [LCov reporter](https://npmjs.org/package/mocha-lcov-reporter)) and send it to Codacy to report your code coverage there.

Once your app is instrumented for coverage, and building, you need to pipe the lcov output to `./node_modules/.bin/codacy-coverage`.

You'll need to provide the Report token from Codacy via an environment variable:
* CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN (the secret repo token from Codacy.com)

> Note: You should keep your API token well **protected**, as it grants owner permissions to your projects.

**Enterprise**

To send coverage in the enterprise version you should:
```
export CODACY_API_BASE_URL=<Codacy_instance_URL>:16006
```

### [Mocha](http://mochajs.org) + [Blanket.js](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket)
- Install [blanket.js](http://blanketjs.org/)
- Configure blanket according to [docs](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/master/docs/getting_started_node.md).
- Run your tests with a command like this:

```sh
NODE_ENV=test YOURPACKAGE_COVERAGE=1 ./node_modules/.bin/mocha \
  --require blanket \
  --reporter mocha-lcov-reporter | ./node_modules/.bin/codacy-coverage
```
### [Mocha](http://mochajs.org) + [JSCoverage](https://github.com/fishbar/jscoverage)

Instrumenting your app for coverage is probably harder than it needs to be (read [here](http://www.seejohncode.com/2012/03/13/setting-up-mocha-jscoverage/)), but that's also a necessary step.

In mocha, if you've got your code instrumented for coverage, the command for a travis build would look something like this:
```sh
YOURPACKAGE_COVERAGE=1 ./node_modules/.bin/mocha test -R mocha-lcov-reporter | ./node_modules/.bin/codacy-coverage
```
### [Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul)

**With Mocha:**

```sh
istanbul cover ./node_modules/mocha/bin/_mocha --report lcovonly -- -R spec && cat ./coverage/lcov.info | ./node_modules/.bin/codacy-coverage && rm -rf ./coverage
```

**With Jasmine:**

```sh
istanbul cover jasmine-node --captureExceptions spec/ && cat ./coverage/lcov.info | ./node_modules/.bin/codacy-coverage && rm -rf ./coverage
```

### [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
- Install & Configure [grunt-codacy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-codacy)

### [Poncho](https://github.com/deepsweet/poncho)
Client-side JS code coverage using [PhantomJS](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs), [Mocha](http://mochajs.org) and [Blanket](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket):
- [Configure](http://mochajs.org#browser-support) Mocha for browser
- [Mark](https://github.com/deepsweet/poncho#usage) target script(s) with `data-cover` html-attribute
- Run your tests with a command like this:

```sh
./node_modules/.bin/poncho -R lcov test/test.html | ./node_modules/.bin/codacy-coverage
```

### [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
- Install & Configure [gulp-codacy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-codacy)

### Troubleshooting

The paths in your coverage file should be relative, if you are having problems with absolute paths, you can run our plugin with `-p .` to strip the current path from the paths in your coverage file:
```
cat ./coverage/lcov.info | node_modules/.bin/codacy-coverage -p .
```
